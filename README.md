### Hey there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>

I’m **Minh**, a developer based in Vietnam.  

I learn by building and experiment with ideas from many different sources.

When something inspires me, I turn it into a personal project and shape it in my own style.

My main tech stack is react, typescript, tailwind, and framer motion. My favorite tools are figma, apple notes, and vscode.

I’ve got a bunch of pinned projects, but my favorite is the [Blog App](https://github.com/...).

I track my weekly coding time, here’s what I’ve been up to:
